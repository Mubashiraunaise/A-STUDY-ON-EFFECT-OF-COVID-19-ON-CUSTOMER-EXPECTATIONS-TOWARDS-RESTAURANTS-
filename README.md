Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on customer behavior and expectations towards restaurants, with a specific focus on Malappuram Municipality. The study explores how the pandemic has influenced dining habits, restaurant preferences, hygiene concerns, and payment methods. The findings reveal a significant shift from dining out to takeout/delivery options, increased preference for contactless payment, and the growing importance of hygiene and safety in restaurant selection.

Key Findings:
Demographic Insights: Majority of restaurant customers are female, below the age of 30, and students.
Behavioral Shifts: Customers are now more likely to choose takeaway/delivery, especially due to concerns over COVID-19 precautions.
Payment Preferences: A strong shift towards contactless payments via mobile devices since the pandemic.
Safety Concerns: Customers prioritize hygiene and safety over price and are afraid to dine in crowded spaces.
Promotional Effectiveness: Social media promotion has proven effective, although many customers do not actively follow restaurants on these platforms.
Customer Expectations: Key hygiene expectations include staff wearing masks and gloves and maintaining physical distance. Open kitchen layouts and outdoor dining options are also highly preferred.
Suggestions:
Restaurants should focus on enhancing takeaway and delivery services while promoting contactless payment options.
Outdoor dining layouts should be considered to reduce health risks.
Creative social media marketing can help engage customers and build trust by emphasizing safety practices.
Conclusion:
The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically altered consumer behavior in the restaurant industry, with a noticeable preference for hygiene, safety, and contactless services. This project provides actionable insights for restaurateurs to adapt to these new expectations, ensuring both customer satisfaction and safety in the evolving market.
